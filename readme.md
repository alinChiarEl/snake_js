# Description

A snake game implemented using Javascript, Html and CSS.
I did not use an animation library.

# Features

- **Controls on Desktop** You can control the snake using the arrows. R = Restart. Space = Pause. Enter = Resume
- **Controls on Mobile** On mobile there are direction keys on the bottom of the screen.
- **Miscellaneous** I create the grid on the fly, using javascript. That is because i have in plan to be able
  to add features to the game, such as to configure the gameboard size, snake speed, and others.
  This is why i do not redraw the grid in the game loop, to save some time.
